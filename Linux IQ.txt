Scenario: Disk Space Issues
=================================
1)You are managing a production server and notice that the disk space is running low. How would you diagnose and resolve this issue on a Linux system?
or
Your production server is running out of disk space. How would you investigate and resolve the issue on a Linux server?"
or
What Linux commands would you use to check disk space usage and find out which files are consuming the most space?
or
You notice that a server is running low on disk space and the df command shows /var is 100% full. How would you proceed with troubleshooting?
or
How would you assess whether running low on disk space is affecting the performance of your Linux server? What steps would you take to mitigate this?
or
What role does log file management play in preventing disk space issues on a production server? How would you handle log files consuming too much space?
or
If you need to automatically clean up space when disk usage exceeds a threshold, how would you configure a script or automation on a Linux server?
or
How would you identify and clean up temporary files or caches that may be using up disk space on a Linux system?
or
You notice large files taking up space on your server. How would you go about identifying and managing these files?
or
Once you've freed up some disk space, how would you prevent disk space issues from reoccurring on the server?
or
Would you always try to clean up disk space, or would you consider adding additional disk space to resolve the issue? What factors would influence your decision?
or
What would you do if a critical application (like a database or web server) is running out of disk space and can't afford to go offline for a cleanup?
or
Sometimes disk space issues are caused by hidden or untracked files (such as deleted files held by processes). How would you identify and deal with such situations?

Answer:
•	First, use the command df -h to check the disk usage on all mounted file systems. This will show you which partitions are near full.
•	Identify the directories with the most significant disk usage using du -sh /* or du -sh /path/to/directory to see what directories or files are taking up the most space.
•	You can also use ncdu (if available) for a more interactive way of viewing disk usage.
•	Once identified, take actions like deleting old files, clearing caches, and rotating logs. Use commands like rm or find to remove unwanted files.
•	Use logrotate to manage log files to prevent them from consuming too much disk space over time.
•	If the problem persists, consider expanding disk space or adding another disk.

Scenario: Process Management
===========================================
2)A critical process has hung on a Linux server, and you need to terminate it without disrupting other services. What steps would you take?
or
How would you terminate a hung process on a Linux server while ensuring that no other services are disrupted?
or
What steps would you take to investigate and fix a process that has hung on your Linux server?
or
What Linux tools would you use to identify and terminate a hung process without affecting other processes or services?
or
In a production environment where high availability is critical, how would you handle a hung process without impacting uptime?
or
What would you do after terminating a hung process to ensure that there are no underlying issues?
or
What would you do if the hung process is part of a service that has multiple dependencies? How would you avoid affecting other services?
or
If the hung process is repeatedly causing issues, how would you approach fixing the root cause instead of just terminating it?
or

Answer:
•	Identify the Process: Use ps aux or top to locate the hung process by examining its PID and resource usage.
•	Try Graceful Termination: First, attempt to stop the process gracefully with kill <PID>, which sends a SIGTERM signal.
•	Forceful Termination: If the process does not respond, use kill -9 <PID> to forcefully terminate it with the SIGKILL signal.
•	Verify Impact: Ensure no critical services are disrupted by checking service statuses with systemctl status <service> or ps aux | grep <service>.
•	Check Logs: After termination, review system logs (/var/log/syslog, journalctl) for any errors or issues related to the hung process.


Scenario: File Permissions
=========================================
3) A user reports they cannot access a specific directory, even though they are part of the group with the necessary permissions. How would you resolve this?
or
A user is in the correct group, but still cannot access a directory. What command would you use to verify the directory’s permissions and diagnose the issue?
or
If a user cannot access a directory, even though the directory permissions appear correct, what else could be causing the issue?
or
What steps would you take if the user still cannot access the directory, even though they have the correct group permissions and parent directory permissions?
or
The user is part of the correct group and should have permissions to access the directory. What error messages might be helpful in troubleshooting, and where would you look for them?
or
What would you check if the user still cannot access the directory even after verifying the directory permissions and group membership?
or
A user is unable to access a directory that’s part of a mounted file system. What could be the cause, and how would you troubleshoot it?or
or
What other factors might prevent a user from accessing a directory, even though group permissions are set correctly?
or
What could prevent access to a directory if all other permissions appear correct?

Answer:
•	First, check the permissions on the directory using ls -l /path/to/directory.
•	Make sure the group permissions are correctly set with rwx for read, write, and execute as needed.
•	Check if the user is indeed a member of the group using groups <username>.
•	If the user isn’t part of the group, you can add them using usermod -aG <groupname> <username>.
•	Ensure the parent directory’s permissions don’t restrict access (e.g., chmod on parent directories).
