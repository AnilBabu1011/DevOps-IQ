Scenario: Disk Space Issues
=================================

or
Would you always try to clean up disk space, or would you consider adding additional disk space to resolve the issue? What factors would influence your decision?
or
What would you do if a critical application (like a database or web server) is running out of disk space and can't afford to go offline for a cleanup?
or
Sometimes disk space issues are caused by hidden or untracked files (such as deleted files held by processes). How would you identify and deal with such situations?

Answer:
•	First, use the command df -h to check the disk usage on all mounted file systems. This will show you which partitions are near full.
•	Identify the directories with the most significant disk usage using du -sh /* or du -sh /path/to/directory to see what directories or files are taking up the most space.
•	You can also use ncdu (if available) for a more interactive way of viewing disk usage.
•	Once identified, take actions like deleting old files, clearing caches, and rotating logs. Use commands like rm or find to remove unwanted files.
•	Use logrotate to manage log files to prevent them from consuming too much disk space over time.
•	If the problem persists, consider expanding disk space or adding another disk.

Scenario: Process Management
===========================================

or
If the hung process is repeatedly causing issues, how would you approach fixing the root cause instead of just terminating it?
or

Answer:
•	Identify the Process: Use ps aux or top to locate the hung process by examining its PID and resource usage.
•	Try Graceful Termination: First, attempt to stop the process gracefully with kill <PID>, which sends a SIGTERM signal.
•	Forceful Termination: If the process does not respond, use kill -9 <PID> to forcefully terminate it with the SIGKILL signal.
•	Verify Impact: Ensure no critical services are disrupted by checking service statuses with systemctl status <service> or ps aux | grep <service>.
•	Check Logs: After termination, review system logs (/var/log/syslog, journalctl) for any errors or issues related to the hung process.

or
A user is unable to access a directory that’s part of a mounted file system. What could be the cause, and how would you troubleshoot it?or
or
What other factors might prevent a user from accessing a directory, even though group permissions are set correctly?
or
What could prevent access to a directory if all other permissions appear correct?

Answer:
•	First, check the permissions on the directory using ls -l /path/to/directory.
•	Make sure the group permissions are correctly set with rwx for read, write, and execute as needed.
•	Check if the user is indeed a member of the group using groups <username>.
•	If the user isn’t part of the group, you can add them using usermod -aG <groupname> <username>.
•	Ensure the parent directory’s permissions don’t restrict access (e.g., chmod on parent directories).

Scenario: Service Failure After Reboot
======================================
4)After a server reboot, an important service (e.g., Apache, MySQL) fails to start automatically. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?
or
A critical service fails to start after a reboot. How would you determine if the service has missing dependencies or configuration issues?

Answer:
•	Check Service Status: Use systemctl status <service> (e.g., systemctl status apache2 or systemctl status mysql) to check the current status of the service and whether it is enabled to start at boot.
•	Check Service Logs: Use journalctl -u <service> to review the logs for any errors or reasons why the service failed to start.
•	Check for Dependencies: Review if any dependent services or resources (like databases, network connections, or mounts) failed to start or are unavailable.
•	Check for Configuration Issues: Verify the configuration files of the service for any errors or misconfigurations (e.g., Apache's httpd.conf, MySQL’s my.cnf).
•	Check System Logs: Check the general system logs (/var/log/syslog, /var/log/messages) for any boot-related errors or messages that could indicate why the service failed.
•	Enable the Service at Boot: Ensure the service is enabled to start on boot with systemctl enable <service>.
•	Manually Start the Service: Try to start the service manually using systemctl start <service> and observe any errors that might provide more details on why it’s failing.

Scenario: Network Troubleshooting
=========================================
5)A server in your data center cannot communicate with an external API. How would you troubleshoot network connectivity issues on Linux?
or
What would you do if the server is unable to communicate with an external API using its domain name?
or
How would you troubleshoot a situation where the server can ping local devices but cannot reach an external API?
or
If your server cannot communicate with an external API, how would you determine if firewall rules are blocking the connection?
or
How would you test if a specific API is reachable from your server using curl or wget ?
or
What if the network connectivity issue is due to packet fragmentation or MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) issues?
or

or
How would you diagnose if the issue is related to the TCP/IP stack on the server?
or
What if the problem lies with a load balancer or a reverse proxy between your server and the external API?

Answer:
•	Check Network Interface Configuration: First, ensure the server has the correct IP address, subnet mask, and gateway configured. Use ip a to verify network interfaces and ip route to check the routing table.
•	Ping the API Server: Try to ping the external API server using its IP address or domain name (e.g., ping api.example.com or ping <API-IP>). This checks for basic network reachability.
•	Traceroute to the API Server: Use traceroute api.example.com or traceroute <API-IP> to identify where the connection fails. This helps to isolate whether the issue is within the local network, at the gateway, or beyond.
•	Check DNS Resolution: If you're using the domain name to access the API, verify DNS resolution with nslookup api.example.com or dig api.example.com. If DNS is not working, check /etc/resolv.conf to ensure correct DNS servers are configured.
•	Check Firewall Rules: Ensure that both local firewalls (e.g., iptables, firewalld) and external firewalls are not blocking the necessary ports for communication with the API. Use iptables -L or firewall-cmd --list-all to review the rules.
•	Check External Routing: Ensure that there are no external network issues or restrictions preventing access to the API. If the server is behind a NAT gateway, check the NAT configuration.
•	Review Logs: Check the system logs (/var/log/syslog, /var/log/messages) for any networking-related errors.
