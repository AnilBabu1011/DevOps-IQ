Scenario: Disk Space Issues
=================================
1)You are managing a production server and notice that the disk space is running low. How would you diagnose and resolve this issue on a Linux system?
or
Your production server is running out of disk space. How would you investigate and resolve the issue on a Linux server?"
or
What Linux commands would you use to check disk space usage and find out which files are consuming the most space?
or
You notice that a server is running low on disk space and the df command shows /var is 100% full. How would you proceed with troubleshooting?
or
How would you assess whether running low on disk space is affecting the performance of your Linux server? What steps would you take to mitigate this?
or
What role does log file management play in preventing disk space issues on a production server? How would you handle log files consuming too much space?
or
If you need to automatically clean up space when disk usage exceeds a threshold, how would you configure a script or automation on a Linux server?
or
How would you identify and clean up temporary files or caches that may be using up disk space on a Linux system?
or
You notice large files taking up space on your server. How would you go about identifying and managing these files?
or
Once you've freed up some disk space, how would you prevent disk space issues from reoccurring on the server?
or
Would you always try to clean up disk space, or would you consider adding additional disk space to resolve the issue? What factors would influence your decision?
or
What would you do if a critical application (like a database or web server) is running out of disk space and can't afford to go offline for a cleanup?
or
Sometimes disk space issues are caused by hidden or untracked files (such as deleted files held by processes). How would you identify and deal with such situations?

Answer:

i)First, use the command df -h to check the disk usage on all mounted file systems. This will show you which partitions are near full.
ii)Identify the directories with the most significant disk usage using du -sh /* or du -sh /path/to/directory to see what directories or files are taking up the most space.
iii)You can also use ncdu (if available) for a more interactive way of viewing disk usage.
iv)Once identified, take actions like deleting old files, clearing caches, and rotating logs. Use commands like rm or find to remove unwanted files.
v)Use logrotate to manage log files to prevent them from consuming too much disk space over time.
vi)If the problem persists, consider expanding disk space or adding another disk.
